Problem:
The purpose of this repository is to more seamlessly integrate our teams code in a way that allows each of us to
download, test, and look at each others code. This also keeps a working file of information in case we lose the 
data on our computers. This will also help as we continue to work on this project for the semester. 

Organization: 
Each of our projects and demos will have their own repository to keep things separated. 

Mini Project: 
We have seperate files for each section of the code and then the entire file for Arduino and Pi codes so that they can be run by downloading the information.
